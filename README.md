# üö® AI-Powered Emergency Detection & Alert System

An intelligent **emergency detection system** built using **PyTorch** (ResNet-18) and a Flask web frontend. Upload an image and the app classifies it into emergency categories (fire, accident, collapse, flood, or normal) and ‚Äî for critical classes ‚Äî can send SMS alerts through **Twilio** with a shortened Google Maps link to the estimated location.

---

## üîç What's included in this repo

* `app.py` ‚Äî Flask web application that loads the trained PyTorch model, accepts image uploads, performs inference, fetches location by IP, shortens Google Maps links, and (optionally) sends Twilio SMS alerts.
* `templates/index.html` ‚Äî Minimal front-end for uploading images and showing predictions (expected to exist in `templates/`).
* `static/` ‚Äî For styles, JS and any static assets used by the front end.
* `best_emergency_model.pth` ‚Äî Trained `ResNet-18` model file used by the Flask app (replace with your fine-tuned model file).

---

## ‚úÖ Features (current)

* Single-file Flask app (`app.py`) that:

  * Loads a ResNet-18 model with a custom fully-connected head matching the repo's class set.
  * Accepts image uploads and returns a predicted label.
  * Uses `geocoder` to get location from the server's IP and builds a Google Maps link.
  * Shortens the Google Maps URL via TinyURL.
  * Sends SMS alerts through Twilio for mapped emergency classes.
  * Returns a base64-encoded version of the uploaded image for frontend preview.

## üìã Class names (must match training)

The app expects the model to output one of these classes (case and ordering used in `app.py`):

```
['accident', 'collapse', 'fire', 'flood', 'Normal']
```

> If your trained model uses a different class order or names, update `class_names` in `app.py` and re-save the model accordingly.

---

## ‚òéÔ∏è Phone mapping for alerts

Only a subset of classes are mapped to phone numbers for SMS alerts. Edit `phone_mapping` in `app.py` with real phone numbers (E.164 format) before enabling Twilio.

Example mapping in `app.py`:

```py
phone_mapping = {
    "fire": "<+1234567890>",
    "accident": "<+1234567891>",
    "collapse": "<+1234567892>",
    "flood": "<+1234567893>
}
```

## üîë Twilio & Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables (do **not** hard-code secrets in source):

* `TWILIO_SID` ‚Äî Your Twilio Account SID
* `TWILIO_AUTH` ‚Äî Your Twilio Auth Token
* `TWILIO_MSG_SID` ‚Äî Messaging service SID (or modify the code to use `from_` for a phone number)

You can export them in Linux/macOS like:

```bash
export TWILIO_SID="your_sid"
export TWILIO_AUTH="your_auth_token"
export TWILIO_MSG_SID="your_messaging_service_sid"
```

---

## üß∞ Dependencies

Install required packages (recommended in a virtualenv):

```bash
pip install flask torch torchvision pillow geocoder twilio requests
```

> If you use a GPU or a different torch build, install the matching `torch`/`torchvision` packages according to your CUDA version.

---

## üöÄ Running the App (development)

1. Ensure the trained model file `best_emergency_model.pth` is present in the project root (or update the path in `app.py`).
2. Set the Twilio environment variables if you plan to use SMS alerts.
3. Run the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser and upload an image.

## üîß Important Implementation Notes

* **Model shape & classes**: `app.py` constructs a `resnet18` and replaces `fc` with a `Linear` layer sized to `len(class_names)`. The model file must match this architecture and class ordering.
* **Location accuracy**: `geocoder.ip('me')` uses IP-based geolocation ‚Äî it is approximate and often inaccurate for precise coordinates. For production, prefer device-supplied GPS or external metadata.
* **URL shortening**: The app calls TinyURL to shorten the Google Maps link. If rate limits are a concern, swap to a self-hosted or paid URL shortener.
* **Twilio limits**: Twilio may block or rate limit messages if the account is not configured correctly. For SMS sending, ensure the Twilio messaging service or `from` number is configured and verified for your destination numbers.
* **Safety checks**: The app currently sends SMS for any mapped label. Consider adding a confidence threshold (e.g. softmax score > 0.6) and human-in-the-loop confirmation before sending alerts.

---

## üîí Security & Privacy

* **Do not commit** Twilio credentials, personal phone numbers, or your model weights to a public repo. Use environment variables and `.gitignore`.
* **User IP & location** collected by the app may be sensitive. Ensure you have consent and follow local privacy laws when storing or transmitting location data.

---

## üõ† Troubleshooting

* **Model load fails**: Check `torch` version compatibility and whether the model was saved with `state_dict()` vs full `torch.save(model)`; adjust loading accordingly.
* **`geocoder` returns `None`**: The machine may not have a public IP or the `geocoder` API could be blocked. Test manually by printing `g.latlng`.
* **Twilio exceptions**: Inspect the exception message returned when sending SMS ‚Äî common issues include invalid credentials, unverified destination numbers, or missing messaging service.

---

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Suggested Improvements for Future enhancements

* Add prediction confidence and only send alerts above a threshold.
* Support live video/CCTV streams (frame-sampling + inference pipeline).
* Add user/role authentication for the web UI and an audit log for sent alerts.
* Deploy behind a production-ready server (Gunicorn + nginx) and enable HTTPS.
* Reduce false alarms with multi-frame confirmation.
* Store incidents in a database for analytics and hotspot mapping.

Enable offline mode with queued alerts for poor connectivity.
